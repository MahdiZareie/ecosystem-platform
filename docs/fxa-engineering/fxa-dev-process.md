We develop and deploy on a one-week cycle. Every Thursday we cut a release
"Train" (ie. a Sprint) that goes through [deployment to stage and into
production](release-process.md).

## Our weekly process

![A visual map of our weekly process](assets/fxa-schedule.png)

Above is a diagram illustrating the high level FxA development process.  It
does not represent all the work each group does, nor does it show every group
that is critical to shipping Firefox Accounts.  It's intention is to give an
idea of timeframes:
* On Tuesday, after sign off from QA, the train is pushed to production
* On Thursday, the Engineering team tags the current train and commits to a new
  set of work for the next train.  The operations team pushes the newly tagged
  train to our staging environment and the QA team starts to test it.
* It's important to note that fixing regressions of the train on Stage is a
  higher priority than fixing new Issues in the current train.  Depending on
  the regression's severity it may be picked to Stage, picked to Production, or
  just ride the train the following week.

## Product Planning

Product-level feature planning is currently managed via Epics in Jira.  Each
feature goes through a comprehensive series of steps from defining and
designing, to building and QA, to measuring changes and results, and finally
closing the Epic.

## Issue management

Most of our work takes place on [GitHub][fxa-repository] and [Jira][fxa-jira].

Issue status is reflected by the following:

* The issue itself will have updates indicating *what* the next action is.
* The assignee, if any, indicates *who* is responsible for that action.
* The Sprint (in Jira) indicates *when* we are working on the issue.
* The Points (in Jira) indicate roughly *how complex* the issue is.

Issues, labels, and assignee are synchronized automatically between GitHub and
Jira (a delay of a minute or two).

We also have two relevant components in Bugzilla:
* [Firefox :: Firefox Accounts][bugzilla-fxa]
* [Cloud Services :: Server: Firefox Accounts][bugzilla-fxa-server]

These components are used to help coordinate between other projects using
Bugzilla and for issues relating to security.  To automatically file a GitHub
bug from Bugzilla, put `[fxa]` in the whiteboard.

If you're wondering where to file a bug, unless it's a security bug, please
file in Jira.

### New Features

New features are expected to be described in an Epic with supporting Tasks and
User Stories (including acceptance criteria).

```mermaid
graph TD
A[Epic] --> B(User Story)
A --> C(User Story)
A --> D(Task)
A --> E(Bug)
```
Generally, we can expect Epics to be written by the Product team.  Tasks and
User Stories will likely be written by the Product and Engineering teams as
they need to be broken down small enough to fit inside of a sprint.  [Learn
more about user stories][moz-user-stories].

As Tasks and Bugs pop up, they should be associated with open Epics as
appropriate.

### Sprints

Sprints are tracked in Jira.  There is a [dashboard for our current
sprint][fxa-jira-dashboard] and a [detailed view of our current
sprint][fxa-jira-sprint].

The amount of work we can accomplish in a sprint depends on how many people are
on the team, how much time those people can devote to the work, and what type
of work it is.  Our [historical velocity is tracked][fxa-jira-velocity], but
past performance is no guarantee of future results.

When considering what you can accomplish in a sprint, remember:
* FxA is a complex project with a lot of moving parts.  If you're not familiar
  with the area, sometimes a simple patch can lead to a rabbit hole that soaks
  up your time.
* All patches are reviewed by another team member who also has their own
  obligations that sprint.  Leave room in your schedule to review patches and
  consider that others might not get to your patch immediately.
* Some patches may require additional review from, for example, the operations,
  security, localization, or data steward teams.  If that's the case it's
  likely it won't land in the same sprint it's written in since our sprints are
  pretty short.

#### How do we decide what to work on?

We take input from many sources including our Product Management, our QA team, our customers (both relying parties and end users), and ourselves.  Usually this input is in the form of tickets filed in Jira.  We triage this input (described in [Bug Triage](#bug-triage)) to determine what is the most important thing to work on in the next sprint.  There are often special cases and reasons to work on things which may find their way into a sprint but for the most part in each Sprint we aim to close, in priority order:

* Blocking bugs that have been found in our production site
* Blocking bugs found in our staging site
* Any high priority work that we didn't finish in the previous sprint (including helping a team member finish their work)
* Any in-progress Epics
* Starting on the next Epic (Epics are in priority order in Jira)

In the midst of that workflow bugs will be reported and found.  If they are important we'll add them to the Sprint.  If they are part of an Epic we're actively working on, we'll add them to that Epic (and thus, they will be closed in short order).  If they aren't a high priority, they'll be put in the backlog.  Occasionally we may take a sprint and work on only bugs to help reduce our backlog.

As of late, we've split into two groups of people working on two Epics in parallel.  This is a good balance between throughput and working as a team.  Having more people work on fewer things means:

* It's easier to find a reviewer for code you write (and less context switching for everyone involved)
* It's easier to find someone with enough context to work through hard questions like architecture design
* More people will have experience with more areas of the code
* Epics will be closed out faster


### Bug Triage

Triage owners rotate throughout the team and we assign new triage owners every
week in our meetings.  The triage owner is responsible for:

* Triaging any new issues in Jira
* Triaging any new issues in Sentry

The goals of our triage rotation are:

* Triaging issues, watching Sentry, understanding general user
  sentiment/feedback is a shared team responsibility instead of a burden on 1
  or 2 engineers
* Knowledge sharing of different areas - a triage owner may not be the expert on
  the topic and would reach out for help and learn from the process.
* Users stay top-of-mind
* 0 untriaged issues by the end of the triage cycle - before handover to the
  next person
  * But it‚Äôs OK to be untriaged before the meeting at the end of the cycle -
    those issues are discussed and triaged at that meeting.

#### Triage Process

* The triage owner updates the team on any significant issues or findings
  during usual meetings
* The triage owner provides a short summary at our team meeting the week
  following their triage week

#### How to triage

In all cases, a call needs to be made about urgency. It‚Äôs fine to not be sure!
If it seems urgent, the issue should remain untriaged, which should force it to
be raised in our team meetings.

Jira is the canonical source of truth for how we track our own work, but bugs
may come in through several other systems that have their own requirements.

##### Errors/Issues/Work Requests/etc reported in Slack

* If someone reports something to our team in Slack - 1st person to see //
  respond should file a bug in Jira and add the link to the slack conversation
  so we know it will be addressed not dropped.
* Item is then triaged as normal when you get to "Jira Issues" below.

##### Sentry
* Sentry issues which may be of concern should have corresponding issues opened
  in Jira, with a link to the Sentry report and a brief description. If you are
  unsure whether a report is of concern or not, assume it is (ie, open an issue
  anyway).
* We should monitor our production instances closely as well as keep an eye out
  on stage for new issues exposed by QA.  There are many projects in the #fxa
  group on Sentry.
* For reports that seem worth following up on, create a corresponding issue in
  Jira.
* In the right-hand sidebar of the sentry issue, there is a "Link to Github
  Issue" button. This can be an easy way to file an issue that will eventually
  be mirrored into Jira.  Otherwise make an issue manually.
  * Issues created from this process will then be triaged as normal in Jira.

##### Jira Issues:
All of the steps above should have produced issues that make their way into
Jira, so now we can look at an overview of all the things that are our
responsibility.

Triage [this Jira incoming issues query][fxa-jira-backlog] - only the issues
under ‚ÄúBacklog‚Äù need triage.

* Some guidance for fields to change:
  * New issues default to Tasks, but is this a Bug instead (that is, a defect)?
    * If it‚Äôs a bug, change the `Type` to `Bug` and set the `Found In` field to an
      appropriate value
  * Is it tied to one of the epics we have filed?
    * Update the `Epic Link` field
  * Does it require UX guidance?
    * Set `needsux` as a label
  * Does it require a Product Manager?
    * Set `needsproduct` as a label
  * Check if there is an appropriate component.  Our most common one is Code Quality.
  * Consider adding a helpful comment!

As you triage the issues move them into "To Do" (or close them).  Repeat for
the rest of the issues in the Backlog.

When you‚Äôre all finished, write a quick summary including any of the open
issues you need help with and put a comment in #fxa-team.


## Estimation and Point Values
Points are assigned to issues in Jira (ideally before starting work üòâ) so that
we can track our velocity over time, which aids in planning.

The goal of estimation is for us to assess the issue in terms of its relative
complexity, effort, and doubt. When applying an estimate, we should consider
all the steps in getting the particular work to a completed (ready for
production) state for our consumer. The should include effort required for code
reviews, security reviews, testing, integration and build/deploy.

| Points | Relative Size | Description                                                                |
| ------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | xs            | This is a trivial change with clearly defined parameters.                  |
| 2      | s             | This is a small change with clearly defined parameters.                    |
| 3      | m             | This is a small change, but there's some uncertainty.                      |
| 5      | l             | Moderately complex, will require some effort but clearly defined.          |
| 8      | xl            | Moderately complex, medium effort, some uncertainty.                       |
| 13     | xxl           | Complex, large effort, well defined (these should be broken down further)  |
| 21     | ‚àû             | Meta issue or We do not have clear scope. (This issue must be broken down) |


## Checkin Meetings

The team meets regularly to stay in sync about development status and ensure
nothing is falling through the cracks.  During meetings we take notes and
afterward we send a summary of each meeting to an appropriate mailing list.

Please see our [project calendar][fxa-calendar] for details.

## Developing on a long running branch

If a branch will survive beyond a couple of days its important to have a bit of
strategy so as to avoid merging frustrations for yourself and your team.  If
possible you should use other options like feature flags, but sometimes a
branch is the best way to go.  Ask your team if you're unsure.  If you need to
use a branch, please keep in mind:
* Your team won't be keeping up with what is landing on the branch.  Regular
  communication and/or demos of where you are at and where you are going can
  help keep your changes in peoples' minds.
* You should rebase against main often to avoid a giant headache when you
  eventually merge
* Consider creating new components instead of editing old ones if you have
  extensive enough changes.  This way it's a very small change to flip from one
  to the other instead of trying to merge.

## Code Review

This project is production Mozilla code and subject to our [engineering practices and quality standards][moz-standards].  Every patch must be [reviewed][moz-code-review] by an owner or peer of the [Firefox Accounts module][fxa-module].

### Review Checklist

Here are some handy questions and things to consider when reviewing code for Firefox Accounts:

* Did test coverage increase, or at least stay the same?
* Does it introduce new user-facing strings?
  * Ensure the strings are finalized and approved.  Double check for any typos.  It's hard to change strings once they get localized.
  * Ensure they will be extracted by being consistent with the code in the package you're working on.
* Does it store user-provided data?
    * The validation rules should be explicit, documented, and clearly enforced before storage.
    * Ensure new stored data has been approved by a data steward.
* Does it display user-controlled data?
    * It must be appropriately escaped, e.g. htmlescaped before being inserted into web content.
* Does it involve a database schema migration?
    * The changes must be backwards-compatible with the previous deployed version.  This means
      that you can't do something like `ALTER TABLE CHANGE COLUMN` in a single deployment, but
      must split it into two: one to add the new column and start using it, and second to
      drop the now-unused old column.
    * Does it contain any long-running statements that might lock tables during deployment?
    * Can the changes be rolled back without data loss or a service outage?
    * Has the canonical db schema been kept in sync with the patch files?
    * Once merged, please update the [deployment doc][fxa-deploy-doc] with details.
* Does it alter the public API of a service?
    * Ensure that the change is backwards compatible.
    * Ensure that it's documented appropriately in the API description.
    * Ensure validation functions are tested thoroughly.
    * Note whether we should announce it on one or more developer mailing lists.
* Does it add appropriate new metrics or logging?
* Does it consider accessibility?

## Browser Support
`Last updated: Sep 18, 2020`

Firefox Accounts must work in the following environments:

- Firefox Desktop ESR - 1
- Firefox for Android ESR - 1
- Firefox for iOS Current Version
- Latest versions of modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Opera, Edge)
- iOS Current Version (iOS WebView)
- Android Current Version (Android WebView)

## Deployment Documentation
We maintain a [private deployment document][fxa-deploy-doc] to keep track of any configuration changes, any database changes, etc.  **Anything that needs to be done aside from deploying updated code should be tracked in this document.**  If your patch needs any additional changes or config you are responsible for putting those notes in this document before the train ends.

Additionally, we should notify our relying parties if we're going to change APIs or configuration details if we can (ie. it may not be prudent if we're changing a configuration variable in response to a security incident).  These notifications should be sent to the [fxacct-notices list][fxacct-notices-list] with enough time for relying parties to adjust their code or reply with any concerns.

## Security issues

Since most of our work happens in the open, we need special procedures
for dealing with security-sensitive issues that must be fixed in production
before being made visible to the public.

We use private bugzilla bugs for tracking security-related issues,
because this allows us to manage visibility for other stakeholders at Mozilla
while maintaining confidentiality.

We use private github repos for developing security fixes
and tagging security-related releases.

### Filing security issues

If you believe you have found a security-sensitive issue with any part of the
Firefox Accounts service, please file it as confidential security bug in
Bugzilla via this link:

* [File a security-sensitive FxA bug][fxa-security-bug]

The Firefox Accounts service is part of Mozilla's [bug bounty program][moz-bug-bounty],
which provides additional guidelines on [reporting security bugs][moz-sec-bugs].

### Making a private point-release

We maintain the following private github repo that can be used for making
security-related point-releases

* https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-private

The recommended procedure for doing so is:

* Check out the private repo, independently from your normal working repo:
  * `git clone git@github.com:mozilla/fxa-private`
  * `cd fxa-private`
  * N.B: Do not add it
    as a remote on your normal working repo,
    because this increases the risk
    of pushing a private fix to the public repo
    by mistake.
* Add the corresponding public repo as a remote named "public",
  and ensure it's up-to-date:
  * `git remote add public git@github.com:mozilla/fxa`
  * `git fetch public`
* Check out the latest release branch and push it to the private repo:
  * `git checkout public/train-XYZ`
  * `git push origin train-XYZ`
* Develop your fix against this as a new branch in the private repo:
  * `git checkout -b train-XYZ-my-security-fix`
  * `git commit -a`
  * git push -u origin train-XYZ-my-security-fix`
* Submit and review the fix as a PR in the private repo,
  targetting the `train-XYZ` branch.
* Tag a point release in the private repo, following the release steps
  * `git checkout train-XYZ; git pull  # ensure we have the merged PR`
  * `grunt version:patch`
  * `git push`
* Push the tag in order to trigger a CircleCI build:
  * `git push origin v1.XYZ.N`
  * N.B: Do not use `git push --tags`
    as this will not correctly trigger
    the CircleCI build.
* File an issue on the public repo
  as a reminder to uplift the fix
  once it has been deployed to production.

Once the fix has been deployed and is safe to reveal publicly, it can be merged
back into the public repo by doing the following:

* Push the private train branch to the public repo,
  as a new branch:
  * `git push public train-XYZ:train-XYZ-uplift`
* Open a PR in the public repo,
  targeting the public `train-XYZ` branch,
  for review and merge.
* Push the tag to the public repo:
  * `git push public v1.XYZ.N`
* Merge the `train-XYZ` branch to main
  following the usual steps to release
