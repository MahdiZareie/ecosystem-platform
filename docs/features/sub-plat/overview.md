This document provides a non-technical overview of Subscription Platform features. 

The Subscription Platform is a catch-all name for a set of interdependent features that allow users to unlock premium value by entering into a subscription relationship with Mozilla. Namely:

1. **Payment & Subscription Creation** - The initial payment funnel where users enter CC information to subscribe to a product.
2. **Billing** - Ongoing billing & receipt emails once a subscription is entered.
3. **Subscription Management UI** - Settings that allow the user to update payment information.
4. **Subscription Support** - Staffed support for end users.
5. **Revenue and funnel metrics** - dashboards in Amplitude and Stripe that provide insights into conversion through the subscription funnel, as well as revenue data such as MRR and churn.
