Account Ecosystem Telemetry is a way for different products in the Firefox Accounts
ecosystem to submit usage telemetry, in such a way that we can learn useful information
about actions performed by the same user in different products, while respecting user
privacy.

It is currently in development and is described in more detail in
[this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rR3uJG8sVtow4plYu6M5Jp5e5zOSrLzdkUx8BdO8kOM/).
Public-facing documention will be moved from that doc onto this webpage
once the system is ready to ship.
