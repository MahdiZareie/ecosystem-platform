title: Architectural Decision Records
---

FxA records major architectural decisions in an [ADR][about] format. An ADR is needed whenever there are multiple viable options to pursue that will require a significant engineering effort. Please find FxA ADRs in the FxA repository:
* https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/blob/main/docs/adr

Before we used ADRs, we also archived our feature design documentation.  It's still available online as well:
